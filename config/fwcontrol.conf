#                 |             | sensors

# interpolate_hdd | 0 or 1      | If set to 1 the program calculates
#                 |             | intermediate values between the data points
#                 |             | defined in "temp_pwm_hdd".
# hyst_hdd        | temp        | Hard drive temperature must be decreased by at
#                 |             | least this value until fan speed can be
#                 |             | reduced.
# decrease_delay  | seconds     | Defines how many seconds must have passed
#                 |             | since last speed increase until the speed can
#                 |             | be decreased.
# stop_delay      | seconds     | Defines how many seconds must have passed
#                 |             | since start of the fan until the fan can be
#                 |             | stopped.
# idle_pwm        | 0-255       | If the fan should be stopped but stop delay
#                 |             | time has not yet passed, then the fan speed
#                 |             | is set to this value.
# error_pwm_sys   | 0-255       | If something goes wrong when reading the
#                 |             | system temperatures then the fan speed is set
#                 |             | to this value (default is 255).
# error_pwm_hdd   | 0-255       | If something goes wrong when reading the hard
#                 |             | drive temperatures then the fan speed is set
#                 |             | to this value (default is 255).
# loglevel        | 0 or 1      | If set to 1 then every speed change will be
#                 |             | written to the logfile.
# interval_sys    | seconds     | Check system temperatures every n seconds.
# interval_hdd    | seconds     | Check hard drive temperatures every n seconds.
